## Customizing it

I tried to keep things organized so you don't have to hunt for files.

- **Change your name/bio:** Check `src/components/sections/Hero/Hero.tsx` and `About.tsx`.
- **Update your skills:** Go to `src/components/sections/Skills/Skills.tsx`. There's a `skills` array there—just add your own tech stack and pick your brand colors.
- **Add your projects:** Look at `src/components/sections/Projects/Projects.tsx`.
- **Styles:** Global variables (colors, fonts) are in `src/app/globals.scss`.
